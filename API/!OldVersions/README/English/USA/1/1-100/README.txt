# AI2001 API

AI2001 does not yet have an API, as of 2023, Sunday, August 6th, but I have been working on one for a few weeks now. It won't be ready for a while.

When it is ready, it will be located separately in this repository:

- [:octocat: `AI2001 API`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/AI2001_API/)
