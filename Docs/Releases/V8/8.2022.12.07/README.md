# Version 8 : Release 2022 December 7th

## V8.2022.12.07

### About

This was a long overdue update. Only 2 branches were modified, but important changes to them were made.

* I updated the `Template-Other` branch, so that its functionality is on par with the current development method. Issue templates, a second funding file, 404 pages, and updates to `/.github/` were added.
* I updated the `Template-SNU-ProgrammingTools` branch, so that its functionality is on par with the current development method. Issue templates, a second funding file, 404 pages, git config file renaming, additional licensing, a `/docs/` folder, pull request templates, a security file, and updates to `/.github/` were added.

This release wasn't tagged, as I don't feel like tagging releases on this project.
