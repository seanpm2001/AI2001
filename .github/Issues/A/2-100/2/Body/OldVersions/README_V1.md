### Description

I decided to make this an issue to give it some priority, so that I can fix it eventually. The README has a formatting bug around the community section, and I can't figure out why it is not rendering correctly (each section below it is rendering inside of the previous section for 3 sections, when the sections aren't connected and should be separate)

I spent time trying to fix it today, but got nowhere. It is likely something really obvious, like a duplicate/missing `<details>` tag. The file is getting too long and will need to be trimmed anyways, but this issue may persist even after reduction.
