# AI2001 Datasets

## Meta datasets

Meta datasets are located in separate repositories. The home of all meta datasets is located in this repository:

- [:octocat: `AI2001 Category: Meta`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/AI2001_Category-Meta/)

Meta datasets are mostly filters that go on top of other datasets. It isn't entirely its own class of datasets.

All datasets are currently a major work in progress.
